      <h1>NO MERCY, NO RESPITE</h1>
      <u><h2>CODE OF COMBAT</h2></u>
      <p>Score 3 victory points at the end of the battle for each enemy unit that was destroyed by a NECRONS NOBLE unit from your army.</p>

      <h1>BATTLEFIELD SUPREMACY</h1>
      <u><h2>PURGE THE VERMIN</h2></u>
      <p>Score 2 victory points at the end of your turn for each table quarter that does not have any enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT units) wholly within it. This objective cannot be scored in the first battle round.</p>
      <u><h2>THE TREASURES OF AEONS</h2></u>
      <p>If you selected this secondary objective, then after both sides have finished deploying, your opponent selects 3 objective markers on the battlefield. Score a number of victory points at the end of your turn if you control one or more of those objective markers, as shown in the table below:</p>
      <table style="text-align: center;">
        <tr>
          <th>NUMBER OF SELECTED OBJECTIVE MARKERS YOU CONTROL</th>
          <th>VICTORY POINTS SCORED</th>

      <h1>SHADOW OPERATIONS</h1>
      <u><h2>ANCIENT MACHINERIES</h2></u>
      <p>If you selected this secondary objective, then after both sides have finished deploying, starting with your opponent, the players alternate selecting objective markers that are not within any playerâ€™s deployment zone to be Ancient Machinery objective markers, until three objective markers have been selected (if there are only one or two such objective markers, then only those objective markers are Ancient Machinery objective markers).</p>
      <p>NECRONS CORE or NECRONS CANOPTEK units from your army can attempt the following action:</p>
      <p>Awaken Ancient Machinery (Action): At the end of your Movement phase, one or more NECRONS CORE or NECRONS CANOPTEK units from your army can start to perform this action. Each unit from your army that starts to perform this action must be in range of a different Ancient Machinery objective marker. A unit cannot start this action while there are any enemy units (excluding AIRCRAFT) in range of the same objective marker. The action is completed at the end of your next Command phase, provided the unit attempting that action is still within range of that Ancient Machinery objective marker.</p>
      <p>Score 3 victory points each time a unit from your army completes the Awaken Ancient Machinery action.</p>
